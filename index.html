<h1 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h1>

<h2 id="data-collector">Data Collector</h2>

<p>In 2017, I worked as a self-employed subcontractor for <a href="https://www.ib-mungel.de">Ingenieurb√ºro Mungel</a>, documenting the heating infrastructure of nearly 200 apartment buildings in central Germany. My role involved gathering measurements, plans, and technical documentation. This data was pivotal for the client in their effort to digitize the heating systems across their real estate.</p>

<p>This experience honed my skills in data collection, attention to detail, and working independently while contributing to a broader technological advancement in the real estate industry.</p>

<h2 id="retail">Retail</h2>

<p>In 2018, prior to commencing my studies, I worked a part-time role at a sportswear store. As a sales associate, my responsibilities included assisting customers and managing inventory to ensure optimal levels. While this role might not have been intellectually challenging, it provided a valuable lesson in effective customer communication.</p>

<p>Arranging inventory allowed me to recognize the immense advantages a well-digitized sales system could offer to streamline operations and enhance customer experiences. </p>

<h2 id="dual-studies">Dual Studies</h2>

<p>As part of a dual curriculum offered by <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a>, I participated in a unique educational concept. This approach involved working for a company while pursuing my studies, a model commonly known as a dual curriculum. More about it can be found <a href="#bachelor">here</a>.</p>

<p>I enrolled in a program to study Business Informatics, a collaboration between <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a>. Over the course of 3.5 years, I gained extensive practical experience by working in various departments within Lufthansa. This opportunity provided me with valuable insights into diverse areas such as:</p>

<h2 id="work">Full Stack Developer</h2>

<p>During the final part of my studies, I had the opportunity to work for <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> at Lufthansa Technik, where I gained valuable insights into DevOps practices.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, as I delved into this experience, I discovered a genuine passion for coding. Consequently, I chose to base my Bachelor's Thesis on a project in collaboration with <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> (more details <a href="#bthesis">here</a>). Following the completion of my studies, I continued working with <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>, starting in March 2022 until the end of 2023 when I moved to Copenhagen for further studies.</p>

<p>During my tenure at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>, I had the opportunity to work with an array of technologies and frameworks, which are listed <a href="#hskills">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> is a SaaS platform dedicated to optimizing airline operations, ultimately enhancing efficiency and reducing carbon footprint. The company places a strong emphasis on agile methodologies and DevOps practices.</p>

<h1 id="education">Education</h1>

<h2 id="upper-secondary">Upper Secondary</h2>

<p>I completed my A-Levels at <a href="https://kronberg-gymnasium.de/">Kronberg Gymnasium Aschaffenburg</a>, a linguistically humanistic high school in Bavaria. Graduating in 2017 with an average of 1.9.</p>

<h2 id="bachelor">Bachelor</h2>

<p>Following my A-Levels, my inclination was towards a math-related field, possibly economics. However, upon discovering the concept of <a href="https://www.learngermanonline.org/dual-studies-in-germany-for-international-students/#:~:text=%27Duales%20Studium%27%2C%20or%20dual,experience%20and%2For%20vocational%20training">&quot;Duales Studium&quot;</a>, my interest was piqued. I applied for a program with <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a> to study Business Informatics, even though I had no prior programming experience. To my delight, I was accepted into the program.</p>

<h3 id="dual-studies">Dual Studies</h3>

<p>In 2018, I started my Bachelor's studies in Business Informatics at <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a>. The dual curriculum operated in quarters rather than semesters, leading to a tightly packed schedule. Surprisingly, I found this structure preferable as it afforded me more time to accumulate practical experience and familiarize myself with Lufthansa.</p>

<p>Throughout my studies, I thoroughly enjoyed both the business-related and information-related components. You can find the detailed curriculum <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/studium/bachelor-dual/wirtschaftsinformatik/?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=PerfMax+-+Master+-+DMM&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=9370723674&amp;hsa_cam=19743372711&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgrnDhOjqgQMVWJRoCR3uxgceEAAYAiAAEgIPlfD_BwE">here</a>).</p>

<h3 id="semester-abroad">Semester Abroad</h3>

<p>In 2020, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Riga, Latvia at <a href="https://www.rtu.lv/en">Riga Technical University</a>. This experience was markedly different from my studies at <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a>, being in a foreign country and adapting to the organizational structure of a public university.</p>

<p>Navigating the challenges of COVID-19 in a new academic environment tested my organizational skills, especially in coordinating various courses. When winter set in, pandemic restrictions necessitated isolation. To utilize this time productively, I immersed myself in learning Angular, a prerequisite for my upcoming practical semester at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>.</p>

<p>Despite COVID-19, I really enjoyed the autumn in Riga and I wouldn't want to miss that time. </p>

<h3 id="bthesis">Thesis</h3>

<p>During the final practical phases of my studies, I had the opportunity to get to know and work for <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>. The &quot;start-up&quot; mentality and the agile, DevOps environment at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> resonated with me, and I aspired to join them full-time upon graduating. To enhance my prospects, I chose to base my Bachelor's Thesis in cooperation with <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>.</p>

<p>In the 7th semester, I therefore focused my Bachelor's Thesis on a technical topic:</p>

<p><em>Agent-Based Generation of Artificial Data To Increase Customer Centricity in the Sales Process</em></p>

<p>In early 2022, I successfully graduated from <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a> with a Bachelor of Science in &quot;Computer Science and Business Administration,&quot; achieving an average of 1.9.</p>

<h2 id="master">Master's Degree</h2>

<p>After dedicating 1.5 years to working full-time as a full-stack developer at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>, I felt the call for a new experience. </p>

<p>As a developer, I deeply understand the criticality of well-defined requirements and the consequences when they lack clarity. Motivated by that and my interest in customer-centricity, I actively engaged in conceptualizing new features for the application I was involved with. During this process, I came to recognize my strength, which lies in my interdisciplinary knowledge:</p>

<ul>
<li>My development background equipped me with a strong technical foundation.</li>
<li>Through my studies, I acquired economic knowledge and strategic thinking.</li>
<li>My belief in user-centricity and a passion for well-designed applications, not only visually but also architecturally.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further enrich my understanding, particularly in creating user-centric services, I applied for the Master's Program in <a href="https://www.aau.dk/uddannelser/kandidat/service-systems-design">Service Systems Design</a> at Aalborg University. I was thrilled to be accepted and thus, since September 2023, I am once again back to being a student üßëüèº‚Äçüéì.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organized:</strong> I am well-organized and have developed this skill throughout my academic and professional journey. Efficient time management and self-organization have been essential in coping with tight schedules. I value productivity and am driven by a dislike for wasted time, though I do acknowledge impatience as a potential weakness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> I prioritize practicality and efficiency, valuing solutions that work effectively rather than endlessly seeking perfection. While I appreciate discussions and collaborative decisions, I lean towards a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persuasive:</strong> When I strongly believe in something, I can effectively convey my perspective and engage in discussions to persuade others. I aim to articulate my thoughts convincingly while being open to alternative viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Charismatic:</strong> I enjoy teamwork and collaboration, and I strive to maintain a polite and charismatic approach. I find fulfillment in working with individuals who share a commitment to contributing effectively within a team.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hskills">Hard Skills</h2>

<p>During my job at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> I've worked with the following technologies, frameworks, languages, and tools:</p>

<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>

<h2 id="healthyego">Engagement</h2>

<p>Upon high school graduation, I co-founded an art and culture association called <a href="https://www.healthyego.studio">HEALTHY EGO</a> with a friend.</p>

<p>The essence of <a href="https://www.healthyego.studio">HEALTHY EGO</a> lies in fostering collaborations among artists and creatives. Our journey began by curating exhibitions, providing a platform for artists from diverse disciplines. However, the onset of COVID-19 compelled us to pivot towards video production.</p>

<p>We are currently planning a relaunch of the website to better showcase the evolving work of our association and to elevate its content and features.</p>

<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various sports. While I've explored a range of disciplines, the ones I seem to be coming back to are jogging and biking.</p>

<p>One notable adventure was a summer expedition with two friends, where we traversed the Alps on gravel bikes. Starting from Munich and concluding at Lake Garda, this 5-day journey covered approximately 500 km and entailed conquering around 6000 meters in elevation.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm a passionate skier (‚õ∑Ô∏è&gt;üèÇ), finding great joy in skiing, particularly on the more challenging slopes. I make it a point to indulge in this passion at least once a year.</p>

<p>Overall, I simply enjoy being outdoors and surrounded by nature. üå≥</p>

<h2 id="other-hobbies">Other Hobbies</h2>

<p>In addition to my primary interests, I have several other hobbies that I find engaging, too:</p>

<p>ü™ë <strong>Architecture and Furniture:</strong>
<br>
I have a keen interest in architecture and particularly admire furniture design, especially when influenced by the Bauhaus movement.
<br></p>

<p>üñåÔ∏è <strong>Visiting Museums:</strong>
<br>
I thoroughly enjoy visiting museums to immerse myself in art, and culture.
<br></p>

<p>ü™¥ <strong>Plant Care:</strong>
<br>
I take delight in nurturing and caring for plants, finding it relaxing and rewarding.
<br></p>

<p>üßëüèº‚Äçüç≥ <strong>Cooking:</strong>
 <br>
 I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with different recipes, exploring my culinary creativity in the kitchen.</p>
