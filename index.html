<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Paul. I am 24 years old and I recently moved to Copenhagen for my <a href="#master">Master's studies</a>. Before that, I was living and <a href="#work">working</a> in Hamburg. I have a <a href="#bachelor">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Business Administration</a> and an intrinsic interest in design, simplicity, and innovation.</p>

<p>This website should help you get to know me. If your time is limited, this is where you can find my ...</p>

<h1 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h1>

<h2 id="data-collector">Data Collector</h2>

<p>In 2018, I worked as a self-employed subcontractor for <a href="https://www.ib-mungel.de">Ingenieurb√ºro Mungel</a> to document the heating infrastructure of nearly 200 apartment buildings in central Germany. With the help of the gathered data (measurements, plans, technical documentation) the client could digitize the heating of his real estate.</p>

<h2 id="retail">Retail</h2>

<p>In 2019, I worked in a sportswear store as a mini job before starting my studies. My task was advising customers and optimizing the inventory. Although not the most intellectual work, I've learned what it means to communicate with customers. While stacking up the inventory, I also realized the tremendous benefits a well-digitized sales system could have. </p>

<h2 id="dual-studies">Dual Studies</h2>

<p>I was part of a dual curriculum offered by [<a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a>](<a class="autolink" href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/</a>). The concept of a dual curriculum is characterized by the fact that you work for a company while studying (more on that <a href="#bachelor">here</a>). In my case, <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a> cooperated with <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a> to offer a program to study Business Informatics. During the 3.5 years, I've worked in different departments within Lufthansa. This allowed me to gather some insights into:</p>

<h2 id="work">Full Stack Developer</h2>

<p>For the last Part of my Studies, I've been working for the <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> of Lufthansa Technik, where I got some insights into DevOps.</p>

<p>Although I really didn't think so when I started my studies, I really enjoyed coding. Hence, I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> (more on that <a href="#bthesis">here</a>) and started working for the <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> afterward. </p>

<p>I have been working for the <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> since March 2022 until the End of 2023 (due to my Studies in Copenhagen).</p>

<p>During that time I have worked with various technologies and frameworks, which are listed <a href="#hskills">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> is SaaS platform for Airlines to optimize their operations. <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> puts emphasise on working agile and DevOps. Find out more about the <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>.</p>

<h1 id="education">Education</h1>

<h2 id="upper-secondary">Upper Secondary</h2>

<p>I did my A-Levels at <a href="https://kronberg-gymnasium.de/">Kornberg Gymnasium Aschaffenburg</a>, which at that time was a linguistically humanistic high school. I graduated in 2017 with an average of 1.9. </p>

<h2 id="bachelor">Bachelor</h2>

<p>After my A-Levels I knew that I wanted to study something math-related, maybe economics. Then I found out about the concept of the <a href="https://www.learngermanonline.org/dual-studies-in-germany-for-international-students/#:~:text=%27Duales%20Studium%27%2C%20or%20dual,experience%20and%2For%20vocational%20training">&quot;Duales Studium&quot;</a> and I got really interested, thus I applied for an offer from <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a> to study Business Informatics. Although I had no touchpoints with programming at that time, I applied anyway and got in.</p>

<h3 id="dual-studies">Dual Studies</h3>

<p>In 2018 I started my Bachelor Studies in Business Informatics at <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a> in Cooperation with the <a href="https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/de-en/">Lufthansa Industry Solutions</a>.
Due to the nature of a dual curriculum, I studied in quarters not Semesters, meaning that the schedule was rather tight. Something I actually prefer, as it meant I had more time to gather practical experience and get to know Lufthansa.
During my studies I really enjoyed both the business-related parts, but also the information-related studies (find the curriculum <a href="https://www.[Nordakademie](https://www.nordakademie.de/en/).de/studium/bachelor-dual/wirtschaftsinformatik/?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=PerfMax+-+Master+-+DMM&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=9370723674&amp;hsa_cam=19743372711&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgrnDhOjqgQMVWJRoCR3uxgceEAAYAiAAEgIPlfD_BwE">here</a>)</p>

<h3 id="semester-abroad">Semester Abroad</h3>

<p>In 2020 I did a Semester abroad in Riga, Latvia. Contrary to the <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a>, the <a href="https://www.rtu.lv/en">Riga Technical University</a> is a public institution and is organized differently. Being in a foreign country at a new, public university during COVID-19 really challenged my organizational skills, e.g. when orchestrating the different courses.
When the winter started, we were obliged to isolate. To keep myself busy I decided to learn Angular. a requirement to do a practical semester at the <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>.
Despite COVID-19, I really enjoyed the autumn in Riga and I wouldn't want to miss that time. </p>

<h3 id="bthesis">Thesis</h3>

<p>During the last practical parts of my studies, I got to know and started working for <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>. As I really enjoyed the &quot;start-up&quot; mentality and the agile, DevOps environment, I really wanted to start working at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> full-time after graduating. To increase my chances, I decided to write my Bachelor's Thesis in cooperation with <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a>. Hence, in the 7th semester, I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis about a rather technical topic:</p>

<p><em>Agent-Based Generation of Artificial Data To Increase Customer Centricity in the Sales Process</em></p>

<p>In early 2022 I graduated from <a href="https://www.nordakademie.de/en/">Nordakademie</a> with a Bachelor of Science in &quot;Computer Science and Business Administration&quot; with an average of 1.9.</p>

<h2 id="master">Master</h2>

<p>After having worked at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> for 1.5 years full-time as a full-stack developer, I decided it was time to experience something new. As a developer, I really understand the importance of having well-defined requirements and the implications if they aren't.
Due to that and the fact that I am really interested in customer-centricity, I got involved in conceptualizing new features for the application I was working on.<br/>
While working on new concepts, I realized my strength which is rooted in my interdisciplinary knowledge:</p>

<ul>
<li>from my development background I have a profound technical understanding</li>
<li>from my studies, I also gained economic knowledge and strategic considerations</li>
<li>my belief in user-centricity and well-designed (not only visually, but architecturally!) applications</li>
</ul>

<p>To learn more about the last point, I applied for the Master's Program at Aalborg University for <a href="https://www.aau.dk/uddannelser/kandidat/service-systems-design">Service Systems Design</a> and got accepted. Hence, since September 2023 I have been back to studying.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h2>

<p><strong>Organized:</strong>
Although rather stereotypical, I believe I am rather well organized. Ever since I started studying I've been reliant on self-organizing and finding time on a tight schedule. I dislike wasting time, and my weakness would probably be that I tend to be impatient. </p>

<p><strong>Pragmatic:</strong>
As said before, I don't like to waste time. Although I believe in discussions and democratic decisions, I am also open to other ideas and finding a good compromise. I believe that always looking for the 100% solutions makes you slow and I often prefer a more pragmatic approach.</p>

<p><strong>Persuasive:</strong>
If I really believe something is right, I can become rather persuasive and like to discuss with the aim of convincing my opposite. </p>

<p><strong>Charismatic:</strong>
However, I do this in a very polite and charismatic way. I enjoy working in teams as long as I know, they are willing to contribute as much as I am.</p>

<h2 id="hskills">Hard Skills</h2>

<p>During my job at <a href="https://www.AVIATAR.com/en">AVIATAR</a> I've worked with the following technologies, frameworks, languages, and tools:</p>

<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>

<h2 id="healthyego">Engagement</h2>

<p>After graduating from high school I and a friend of mine co-founded an art and culture association, called <a href="https://www.healthyego.studio">HEALTHY EGO</a>. </p>

<p>The idea of <a href="https://www.healthyego.studio">HEALTHY EGO</a> is to coordinate collaborations between artists and creatives. We started by facilitating exhibitions giving artists from different disciplines a stage. Due to Covid-19, our engagement shifted more towards video production. </p>

<p>As the website doesn't really represent the current work of our association, a relaunch of the website is planned.</p>

<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy sports. I've tried a lot of different disciplines, but the ones I seem to be coming back to are jogging and biking. </p>

<p>This summer, together with two friends we crossed the Alps on gravel bikes. We went from Munich to Lake Garda in 5 days, doing
roughly 500 km and 6000 meters in elevation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am a really passionate skier (‚õ∑Ô∏è&gt;üèÇ). I really enjoy skiing and try to do it at least once a year. The more back slopes, the better.</p>

<p>In general, I enjoy being outside.üå≥</p>

<h2 id="other-hobbies">Other Hobbies</h2>

<p>Furthermore, I am also interested in architecture and furniture (especially if influenced by Bauhaus).
I also enjoy visiting museums üñåÔ∏è, taking care of my plants ü™¥, and cooking üßëüèº‚Äçüç≥.</p>
