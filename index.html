<h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>

<p><em>This is where a nice visualization of my milestones will go</em> </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi, this is Paul writing. I am 24 years old and I live in Copenhagen. </p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h2>Data Collector</h2>

<p>In 2018, I worked as a self-employed subcontractor for Ingenieurb√ºro Mungel to document the heating infrastructure of nearly 200 apartment buildings in central Germany. With the help of the gathered data (measurements, plans, technical documentation) the client could digitize the heating of his real estate.</p>

<h2>Retail</h2>

<p>In 2019, I worked in a sportswear store as a mini job before starting my studies. My task was advising customers and optimizing the inventory. Although not the most intellectual work, I've learned what it means to communicate with customers. While stacking up the inventory, I also realized the tremendous benefits a well-digitized sales system could have. </p>

<h2>Dual Studies</h2>

<p>I was part of a dual curriculum offered by Lufthansa Industry Solutions. The concept of a dual curriculum is characterized by the fact that you work for a company while studying. In my case, Lufthansa Industry Solutions cooperated with Nordakademie to offer a program to study Business Informatics. During the 3.5 years, I've worked in different departments within Lufthansa. This allowed me to gather some insights into:</p>

<ul>
<li>SAP</li>
<li>Data Analytics</li>
<li>UX</li>
<li>Technology Scouting &amp; 5G</li>
<li>Workers Council and internal politics</li>
<li>GDPR (dt. DSGVO)</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>

<p>For the last Part of my Studies, I've been working for the AVIATAR of Lufthansa Technic, where I got some insights into DevOps.</p>

<p>Although I really didn't think so when I started my studies, I really enjoyed coding. Hence, I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis in cooperation with the AVIATAR (more on that <a href="#bthesis">here</a>) and started working there afterwards. </p>

<p>I have been working for the AVIATAR from March 2022 until the End of 2023 (due to my Studies in Copenhagen).</p>

<p>During that time I have worked with the following technologies and frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Spring Boot</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>Openshift</li>
<li>Git (Bitbucket)</li>
<li>Jira</li>
<li>Maven</li>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
